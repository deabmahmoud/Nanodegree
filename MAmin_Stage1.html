			<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
			<p><strong>CSS </strong>(Cascading Style Sheet) is a language used to create presentation of a webpages.  
			CSS can be included in a webpage by writing CSS in the &lt;head&gt; section of HTML, linking the CSS file in the HTML document, and writing style inline with HTML.  Last option is not preferred since it may cause a lot of repeated code.
			With CSS, one can apply same style to a tag that appear multiple times in HTML code so that you are not repeating code to apply same style.
			Elements can inherit styles from thier parent.</p>
